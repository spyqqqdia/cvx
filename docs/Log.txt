Fixed numerous bugs including errors in docs/cvx_notes, hessian of test function in example.
Added
    MatrixUtils.solveWithPreconditioning
solver for positive semidefinite system Hx=b (regularized to (H+delta*I)x=b if nearly singular.

Rewrote UnconstrainedSolver to use this solver for the Newton step.
Added tests for all the linear equation solvers.

Status: compiles and runs, all tests working.

Numerous new classes (Solution, ObjectiveFunction, Solver,...) to clean up current state.
Started with BarrierSolver.

Status: unfinished.
Code compiles, but the new versions of Type1 power test functions do not work with the UnconstrainedSolver,
output on test. Some items in the solution object empty?

The normSquared test function does work.
