Fixed numerous bugs including errors in docs/cvx_notes, hessian of test function in example.
Added
    MatrixUtils.solveWithPreconditioning
solver for positive semidefinite system Hx=b (regularized to (H+delta*I)x=b if nearly singular.

Rewrote UnconstrainedSolver to use this solver for the Newton step.
Added tests for all the linear equation solvers.

Status: compiles and runs, all tests working.

Numerous new classes (Solution, ObjectiveFunction, Solver,...) to clean up current state.
Started with BarrierSolver.

Status: unfinished.
Code compiles, but the new versions of Type1 power test functions do not work with the UnconstrainedSolver,
output on test. Some items in the solution object empty?

The normSquared test function does work.

Massive rewrite. Added Traits SamplePoint (of convex set), FeasiblePoint (of constraint set),
SolutionSpace reworked, finished BarrierSolver.

Status: code compiles, completely untested, known bug of 2016-12-06 unresolved.
Probably full of bugs.

Renamed TestFunction --> MinimizationProblem, some changes (e.g contains objective Function as value etc.)

#--------------------------------------------------------------

Consolidated solver parameters (maxIter, alpha,...) into case class.
Finished BarrierSolver, OptimizationProblem.

Code compiles, equation solving tests go through.
Minimization solvers totally untested.

Renamed:
OptimizationSolution ---> KnownMinimizer
Solution ---> SolverResult

Finished: power function problems and standard list of OptimizationProblems
(in OptimizationProblems).
Some bugfixes, especially in MatrixUtils.solveWithPreconditioning, where we have to
catch all Exceptions on the first try (could be breeze.linalg.NonConvergedException and not only
our own LinSolveException) to get into the catch block where we do the regularization.

Status: compiles, test of standard problems goes through.
