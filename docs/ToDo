Status: code compiles and runs but __nothing working__,
newton steps are not descent directions, hessians of convex test functions
often not positive semidefinite.

Improve diagnostics in
           TestUnconstrainedMinimization::testList
print value of known global min, value at solution.

Test the backsolve routine. The forwardsolve routine is already tested.

Implement
             MathUtils.solveWithPreconditioning
for a posiive semidefinite system.
