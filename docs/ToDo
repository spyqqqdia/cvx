Status: code compiles and runs but __nothing working__,
newton steps are not descent directions, hessians of convex test functions
often not positive semidefinite.

Improve diagnostics in
           TestUnconstrainedMinimization::testList
print value of known global min, value at solution.

Test the backsolve routine. The forwardsolve routine is already tested.

Implement
             MathUtils.solveWithPreconditioning
for a positive semidefinite system.

Add new Exception LinSolveException when solving Ax=b fails. Should contain
message as well as the matrix A, the vector b instead of adding these as strings
to the message.

Add class Constraint (inequality constraint), has id, gradient, hessian, method to check
if it is satisfied, strictly satisfied with margin of error etc.

Introduce class MinimizationProblem:
has objective function with gradient and hessian and constraints as well as a method
allocating a solver.

Rename the current TestFunctions to MinimizationProblems.

Then do the BarrierSolver.

Find out why the Type1 power test functions produce no output in the test.
Complete the BarrierSolver: factory functions for versions with and without equality constraints.
