Status: code compiles and runs but __nothing working__,
newton steps are not descent directions, hessians of convex test functions
often not positive semidefinite.

Improve diagnostics in
           TestUnconstrainedMinimization::testList
print value of known global min, value at solution.

Test the backsolve routine. The forwardsolve routine is already tested.

Implement
             MathUtils.solveWithPreconditioning
for a positive semidefinite system.

Add new Exception LinSolveException when solving Ax=b fails. Should contain
message as well as the matrix A, the vector b instead of adding these as strings
to the message.

Add class Constraint (inequality constraint), has id, gradient, hessian, method to check
if it is satisfied, strictly satisfied with margin of error etc.

Introduce class MinimizationProblem:
has objective function with gradient and hessian and constraints as well as a method
allocating a solver.

Rename the current TestFunctions to MinimizationProblems.

Then do the BarrierSolver.

Find out why the Type1 power test functions produce no output in the test.
Complete the BarrierSolver: factory functions for versions with and without equality constraints.

Implement the affine changed power function minmization problems, factory function
OptimizationProblems.randomPowerProblem,
See docs/cvx_notes.pdf, p5, Example 2.1, where all $phi_j(x) = (x*x)^q$ with q>1 to ensure
twice continuous differentiability.

Implement the constrained test problems.

New optimization problem
                     OptimizationProblems.minX1
with constraints fails the test: backtracking line search does not reach sufficient decrease
after 100 iterations (in UnconstrainedSolver::solve). This is only explicable if the objective function
or the gradient are messed up.

Next: implement KKT system solver with block elimination in MatrixUtils.

Implement quadratically constrained quadratic problems (faster setup), then add many test
problems with known solutions.
