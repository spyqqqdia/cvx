  * interpreted as a probability distribution.
  *
  * The purpose is to have some examples to test feasibility analysis

    * inequality for P(B).
    *
    * This is feasible if and only if pA+pB<=1.
    * The constraints x_j>0 are included but the equality constraint
    * sum_jx_j=1 must be added separately.

    *            where u_j=0.0, if j is not in A, and u_j=1.0, if j is in A.
    * @param I_B indicator function of the subset B of Omega (similar to I_A).
    * @param sgnA: intended to be +-1, but anything nonzero works.
    *              If >0 the inequality is P(A)<=pA, if <0 it is P(A)>=pA.
