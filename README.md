# cvx

The project intends to implement a dense solver for convex minimization along the lines described   
in the book Convex Optimization by Boyd-Vandenberghe.

Code will address only small to medium sized problems without possibility to take advantage of sparsity structures  
but will work with arbitrary twice continuously differentiable convex objective functions and inequality constraints.   
Equality constraints must be of the affine form Ax=b as usual.
